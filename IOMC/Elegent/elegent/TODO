* BH model - problem with N_g

* BSW model - investigate first, then send email
 - problem with complex logarithm
 - factor in front of the regeon term
 - energy dependence S0 does actually depend on t.
 - signatures of reggeons?
 - make sure that the integration accuracy is sufficient!

* model problems (BH, BSW) to Wiki

* finish Wiki

* add `environment' hints to README

* README
 - the names and a brief description of all the files that make up the package
 - clear instructions on the installation and execution of the program

* update make_release

* update TOTEM TWiki, cfg files (new label scheme, how to get available model list)

* check compatibility with old curves

* plots: grid in Asymptote

* problem with low |t| sampling: visible in B(t)

* web - distributions - naming scheme


-------------------- long term --------------------

* add more models (e.g. Brazilian group)?

* Jenkovszky model: other trajectory parameterisations than Eq. (8)?

* custom integration --> some standard library (e.g. GSL)

* use of GNU automake system
